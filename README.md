# Hardware Control
The `hardware` directory contains a module for controlling Eyelink and Netstation hardware from a PsychoPy experiment. This can be done using either the coder or builder approach

- If using the coder, follow the example in hardware/code.md (just an example of using existing libraries)
- If using the builder, follow the directions under #H

## Prerequisites
- PsychoPy2
- For Eyelink: https://github.com/ndiquattro/pylinkwrapper
- For Nestation: https://github.com/gaelen/python-egi

To install these modules in PsychoPy (standalone version), clone or download the repositories and place them in PsychoPy/lib/site-libraries

To install these modules in PsychoPy (environemtn version), clone or download and install with the respective setup.py files.
